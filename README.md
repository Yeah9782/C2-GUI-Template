# C2 GUI Template

This project is provided to give you an example of a C2 GUI coded in C++. I understand a lot more functionality can be added and I plan on adding more in the future.

# Notice
No network functionality is included, this is only a template to refrenece if you want to make your own C2 GUI. I am currently trying to implement OpenSSL in both the server and client. If I am able to implement OpenSSL I will update the repositoy to include the server and client.
