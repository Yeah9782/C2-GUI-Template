# C2 GUI Template

This project is provided to give you an example of a C2 GUI coded in C++. I understand a lot more functionality can be added and I plan on adding more in the future.

# Acknowledgements

* Thanks goes to [@Jackson_T](https://twitter.com/Jackson_T) and his great tool [TelemetrySourcerer](https://github.com/jthuraisamy/TelemetrySourcerer). His code was great for learning about creating a GUI using Win32 API.
* Thanks to Nir Sofer and his [iconsext](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/iconsext.html) software (IconsExtract). This was perfect for getting icons from both Windows and other process. Highly recommend if you are looking for a way to get Windows icons.

# Notice
No network functionality is included, this is only a template to refrenece if you want to make your own C2 GUI. I am currently trying to implement OpenSSL in both the server and client. If I am able to implement OpenSSL I will update the repositoy to include the server and client.
