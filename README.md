# C2 GUI Template

This project is an example of a C2 GUI coded in C++ using Win32 API. I understand a lot more functionality can be added and I plan on adding more in the future. I also acknolwedge that my code is not perfect. This is my first code release.

# Acknowledgements

* Thanks to [Gh0st RAT](https://github.com/sin5678/gh0st). I personally love this RAT. Contains a lot of great code to learn from.
* Thanks to [Quasar RAT](https://github.com/quasar/Quasar). While working on this project, I refrenced this code for GUI ideas and C2 features.
* Thanks to [@Jackson_T](https://twitter.com/Jackson_T) and his great tool [TelemetrySourcerer](https://github.com/jthuraisamy/TelemetrySourcerer). His code was great for learning about creating a GUI using Win32 API. Furthermore, check it out if you wanna learn about Kernel-mode Callbacks, User-mode Hooks, and ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) utilized by EDRs.
* Thanks to Nir Sofer and his [iconsext](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/iconsext.html) software (IconsExtract). This software is perfect if you need icons related to Windows or other software installed on your machine, highly recommended.

# Notice
No network functionality is included, this is only a template to refrenece if you want to make your own C2 GUI or learn about GUIs in general. I am currently trying to implement OpenSSL in both the server and client projects I am working on. If I am able to implement OpenSSL I will update the repositoy to include both the server and client.
